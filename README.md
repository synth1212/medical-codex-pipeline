## Purpose
This assignment simulates actual work you'd do as a data engineer or data scientist in healthcare technology. Companies like Epic, Cerner, or health insurance providers maintain exactly these types of data pipelines to ensure their systems have current medical coding standards.

The skills developed:

* Healthcare data domain knowledge
* ETL pipeline development
* Data quality validation
* File format optimization
* Production-ready code practices

## Instructions
Create Python scripts that can process each medical codex listed below into standardized CSV format. Your pipeline should handle data cleaning, validation, and format conversion for production use.

## Target Medical Codexes

1. **SNOMED CT (US)** - Clinical terminology
2. **ICD-10-CM (US)** - Diagnosis codes  
3. **ICD-10 (WHO)** - International diagnosis codes
4. **HCPCS (US)** - Healthcare procedure codes
5. **LOINC (US)** - Laboratory test codes
6. **RxNorm (US)** - Medication codes
7. **NPI (US)** - Healthcare provider identifiers
